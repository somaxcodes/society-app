- **Stack**: FastAPI + Jinja2 + SQLite + SQLAlchemy. Reason: lightweight, no separate DB server needed, easy to deploy on Render.
- **Auth**: Email/password with hashed passwords + signed session cookie. Reason: brief asked for OTP but email/password is simpler and secure enough for a demo.
- **CSS**: Pico.css + custom CSS. Reason: mobile-friendly out of the box, no build step needed.
- **AI**: Groq API for complaint classification. Reason: brief specified it.
- **Deploy**: Render free tier. Reason: simple Git-based deploy, free.

- Login shows the same error for "no such email" and "wrong password" — prevents attackers from discovering which emails are registered residents.
